I am Yichen Gao, a graduate student in Financial Engineering at Cornell University. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China.

My academic interests lie in quantitative finance, statistical modeling, and machine learning applications in capital markets. I enjoy using data-driven approaches to explore market behavior and build systematic trading strategies. Previously, I have conducted research on volatility surface arbitrage, multi-factor modeling, and algorithmic execution in electronic markets.

I am skilled in Python, R, C++, and SQL, and have hands-on experience with financial data analysis, backtesting frameworks, and predictive modeling. Outside of academics, I served as the president of the Student Bridge Association, where I led a growing team and organized multiple campus-wide events.

I am passionate about using technology and mathematics to solve real-world financial problems, and Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate on challenging projects that bridge theory and practice.

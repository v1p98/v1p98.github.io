- **Regression-based arbitrage strategy on the IV surface** Cornell University, Ithaca, US
  -Continuously tracked and fitted the implied volatility surface to identify mispriced options。
  -Developed a backtesting system based on Level 2 SPX option market data.

- **Algorithmic Trading in Electronic Markets (team of 2)** Cornell University, Ithaca, US
  -Analyzed and identified key drivers for algorithm design.
  -Designed and backtested a time-weighted, score-based execution strategy with machine learning–based parameter
   optimization.

- **Barra Multi-Factor Model Construction**  
  -Constructed the most efficient portfolio by deriving the stock return covariance matrix from the Barra multi-factor
   model and applying Markowitz portfolio optimization.
  -Tried to train multi-layer perceptrons, recurrent neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines on style
   factors to construct machine learning factors and enhance the behavior of the portfolio.
  -Achieved an annualized return of 19.65% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.79。
